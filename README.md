# R Regression Exports (Simulated using Python for demonstration)

This repository contains regression analysis outputs for two classic built-in R datasets: **mtcars** and **iris**.
These results demonstrate how to perform linear regression, export summaries, predictions, and plots.

##  mtcars Regression (`mpg ~ hp + wt`)

- **model1_summary.txt**: Summary of linear regression model predicting MPG using horsepower and weight.
- **mtcars_predictions.csv**: Predicted MPG values for new combinations of hp and wt.
- **mtcars_regression_plot.png**: Scatter plot of hp vs mpg with a regression line.

##  iris Regression (`Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width`)

- **iris_model_summary.txt**: Summary of linear regression model predicting petal length using petal width.
- **iris_predictions.csv**: Predicted petal lengths for new petal width values.
- **iris_regression_plot.png**: Scatter plot of petal width vs petal length with a regression line.

##  How to Use

If you're working in R, the logic follows this structure:
All plots and outputs were simulated using Python but mimic what you'd generate in R.
